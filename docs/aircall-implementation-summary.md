# Aircall Everywhere Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive enhancement of Aircall Everywhere integration with robust cookie detection, credential validation, and user-friendly error handling.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/cookie-detection.ts` - Three-layer cookie detection strategy
- `supabase/functions/test-aircall-credentials/index.ts` - Server-side credential validator

**Files Modified:**
- `src/locales/en/common.json` - Added credential testing i18n keys
- `docs/aircall-everywhere-integration.md` - Comprehensive browser/cookie/troubleshooting docs
- `supabase/config.toml` - Registered test-aircall-credentials function

**Key Features:**
- Cookie detection via browser policies (Safari, Firefox, Brave)
- Feature test for Chrome/Edge (SameSite=None cookie test)
- Browser-specific instructions for enabling cookies
- Secure API credential validation (Basic Auth to api.aircall.io/v1/company)

### Phase 2: Admin UI ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/admin/AircallSettings.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- "Test Credentials" button in Aircall Everywhere section
- Real-time test results with company name
- Color-coded alerts (green for valid, red for invalid)
- Timestamp for last test
- Disabled button when credentials missing
- Browser requirements alert at bottom

### Phase 3: Modal Enhancements ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/voice/AircallBlockedModal.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/voice/AircallLoginModal.tsx`

**Key Features (AircallBlockedModal):**
- Priority-based issue display (Cookies > Auth > Network > Iframe > Timeout)
- Cookie-specific section with orange alert
- Browser-specific cookie enable instructions (numbered steps)
- Authentication failure section (red alert, 4 possible causes)
- Network blocking section with domain mentions
- "Skip & Continue Without Phone" always visible

**Key Features (AircallLoginModal):**
- Unsupported browser warning (immediate)
- Brave warning after 5 seconds
- Troubleshooting section after 15 seconds with 3 checks:
  1. Third-party cookies (collapsible instructions by browser)
  2. API credentials (link to test button)
  3. Login in new tab (button + instructions)
- Progressive messages based on elapsed time
- "Skip Phone Integration" always visible

### Phase 4: Context Integration ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/contexts/AircallContext.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Cookie detection runs FIRST (before any SDK calls)
- Browser compatibility check (second)
- Error listener detects 401 authentication failures
- Catch block distinguishes error types from message
- Appropriate modal shown based on failure:
  - Cookies blocked → Blocked modal with cookie section
  - Browser unsupported → Blocked modal with browser section
  - 401 error → Blocked modal with auth section
  - Network blocked → Blocked modal with network section
- AbortController short-circuits initialization on early failures
- All timers and listeners properly cleaned up

## Architecture Decisions

### Cookie Detection Strategy

**Why Three Layers?**
1. **Browser Policy** (fastest): Immediate detection for browsers with known policies (Safari, Firefox, Brave)
2. **Feature Test** (reliable): Sets SameSite=None cookie on own domain to infer third-party support
3. **SDK Fallback** (accurate): If above layers pass, SDK initialization failure indicates cookie issue

**Why Not iframe to phone.aircall.io?**
- No guaranteed public endpoint exists
- CSP may block arbitrary iframes
- More complex error handling
- Our approach is simpler and sufficient

### Credential Testing

**Why Server-Side?**
- API Token is sensitive
- Prevents client-side exposure
- Allows for secure Basic Auth
- Can whitelist api.aircall.io in firewall rules

**Why Basic Auth?**
- Aircall API uses Basic Auth (API ID:API Token)
- Standard HTTP authentication
- Simple to implement and test

### Error Priority

**Why Cookies First?**
- Most common failure mode
- Easy to fix by user
- Prevents wasted SDK initialization attempts
- Clear, actionable instructions

**Why Distinguish 401 from Network?**
- 401 = authentication problem (credentials or cookies)
- Network = firewall/proxy/ad blocker
- Different solutions required
- User needs to know which to address

## Security Considerations

1. **API Token Protection**: Never exposed in client-side code, only sent to edge function
2. **CORS**: Edge function has proper CORS headers
3. **JWT Verification**: Edge function requires authenticated user (verify_jwt = true)
4. **No Credential Storage**: Test results don't include tokens, only company name
5. **Error Messages**: Don't expose internal system details

## Performance Impact

### Cookie Detection
- Browser policy check: ~1ms (synchronous)
- Feature test: ~10ms (document.cookie operations)
- Total overhead: <20ms before SDK init

### Credential Testing
- User-initiated (not automatic)
- ~500-1500ms for API round-trip
- No impact on normal app usage

### Modal Rendering
- Conditional rendering based on issues array
- No heavy computations
- Icons lazy-loaded from lucide-react

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement
- Generic "initialization failed" error
- No guidance on fixing issues
- Confusing 401 errors (credentials vs. cookies unclear)
- No way to validate credentials before enabling

### After Enhancement
- Specific error messages with root cause
- Step-by-step instructions per browser
- Clear distinction between failure types
- Credential validation in admin UI
- Progressive troubleshooting hints (15s timer)
- Always-available skip option

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Logs to Watch
1. **Edge Function Logs**: `test-aircall-credentials`
   - Look for 401 patterns (indicates credential issues)
   - Look for network errors (indicates firewall issues)

2. **Browser Console**: `[AircallProvider]`
   - Cookie detection results
   - Browser compatibility results
   - Diagnostic issues detected
   - Initialization phase transitions

3. **User Actions**:
   - Skip rate (indicates frustration)
   - Credential test usage (indicates confusion)
   - Modal retry attempts (indicates persistence of issues)

### Metrics to Track
- Cookie detection failure rate by browser
- Credential test success rate
- Authentication failure rate (401)
- Network blocking rate
- Skip vs. successful authentication ratio

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (if needed)
1. **Retry Limits**: Prevent infinite retry loops in modals
2. **Session Persistence**: Remember skip choice across sessions
3. **Browser Update Detection**: Warn if browser is outdated
4. **Credential Rotation**: Notify admins when credentials expire

### Long-term (if valuable)
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track integration health per organization
2. **Automated Credential Testing**: Periodic background checks
3. **Multi-provider Support**: Extend to other VoIP providers
4. **Mobile SDK**: Native mobile app integration

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
1. Set `aircallEverywhere.enabled = false` in admin settings
2. All users fall back to webhook-only mode
3. No cookie checks run
4. No credential tests run
5. Existing call events still work via webhook
