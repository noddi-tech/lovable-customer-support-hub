## For Developers

### Adding Audit Logging to New Features

```typescript
import { useAuditLog } from '@/hooks/useAuditLog';

function MyComponent() {
  const { logAction } = useAuditLog();

  const handleAction = async () => {
    // Perform your action
    await updateSomething();

    // Log it
    await logAction(
      'custom.action',        // Action type
      'resource',             // Target type
      resourceId,             // Target ID
      resourceName,           // Human-readable identifier
      { /* changes */ },      // What changed
      organizationId          // Optional org context
    );
  };
}
```

### Available Action Types

- `user.role.assign` - Role assigned
- `user.role.remove` - Role removed
- `user.update` - Profile updated
- `user.delete` - User deleted
- `user.create` - User created
- `org.create` - Org created
- `org.update` - Org updated
- `org.delete` - Org deleted
- `org.member.add` - Member added
- `org.member.remove` - Member removed
- `org.member.role.update` - Member role changed

### Action Categories

- `user_management` - User-related actions
- `org_management` - Organization actions
- `role_management` - Role changes
- `bulk_management` - Bulk operations

### Security Rules

✅ **Always log these actions:**
- User creation/deletion
- Role assignments/removals
- Organization changes
- Membership changes
- Security-related updates

❌ **Don't log:**
- Regular user activities (viewing, reading)
- System-generated actions
- Non-administrative operations

### Best Practices

1. **Include context**: Use meaningful identifiers (emails, names)
2. **Capture changes**: Include what changed, not just that it changed
3. **Handle errors**: Wrap logging in try-catch, don't break main flow
4. **Be consistent**: Use established action types and categories
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify logs are created for all new features

## Troubleshooting

### "No audit logs showing"
- ✅ Check you're logged in as super_admin
- ✅ Try "All time" date range
- ✅ Clear all filters

### "Cannot create audit log"
- ✅ Ensure user is authenticated
- ✅ Check all required fields are provided
- ✅ Look for console errors

### "Logs are slow to load"
- ✅ Use date range filters
- ✅ Don't query "All time" with 1000+ logs
- ✅ Apply specific filters to reduce dataset
